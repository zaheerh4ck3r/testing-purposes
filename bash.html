		<p>to think i met you in this timeline, a one in a trillion chances of being born, a 0.001% chance of knowing you though i didnt j get to know u i got to love u oh how wonderful the destiny is im gonna believe in this destiny which made me fall in love and ask you do you wanna dance with me on 'thinking out loud' at opera, do you wanna be the 'someone' i've been searching to whom i can look upto and say 'yk whats the difference between her and sky? when she laughs i forget the sky' do you wanna be the girl whose eyes remind me of constellations, do you wanna be the somoene who's frozen and i melt her ice, in the pages of love story do you want me to be your forever writer do you want me to throw all my dictionaries and name you as my language?, do you wanna be the someone who i miss between the space of seconds, do you wanna be the poetry i can write, do you want me to say this after five years 'When I first met you thats what i remember. I looked up at the sky and thought I am going to love this person because even the sky looks different, do you want me to be your favorite hiding place your favorite hiding place, the place u can put everything u know u need to survive, every secret, every solitude, every nervous prayer, and be absolutely certain I will keep it safe, do you wanna crave your initials into every tree of the forest living inside me, above all do you wanna be my imama would you be the tune that waltzes within my heart, the symphony that plays as our paths meet, and the song we compose with each step on life's grand stage? could you become the paint on the canvas of my world, the stroke that colors my days with joy, and the masterpiece i'll hold dear forever? can you light up my darkest nights like a spark, warm my coldest days like a fire, and be the everlasting flame in our story? will you be the opening chapter of our love tale, the twist that takes me by surprise, and the moment that leaves us breathless? shall you be my guiding moon through the night, my morning sun that brightens my days, and the celestial body steering my tides of emotion? be the piece that fits my life's puzzle, the word that ends my sentences, and the answer to every 'why' i've ever wondered. whisper in the wind just for me, share secrets only we understand in busy rooms, and let our love story unfold in each stolen glance i promise i'll love u as misfortune loves orphans, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch eeverything go wrong because I find more love in storm with you than thousand sunny days without you and you'll never be unloved by me you're so tangled to my soul darling you're the best thing that has ever happened to me
