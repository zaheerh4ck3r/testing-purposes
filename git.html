                In the garden of starlight, where dreams softly sway,
                There blooms a question, in twilight's gentle array.
                Fareeha, a flower in the moonlit night,
                Would you dance with me beneath the silver light?
                
                Your laughter, a melody in the evening breeze,
                In your eyes, constellations that put the stars at ease.
                With each step, the universe unfolds,
                Shall we share a moment, where our story molds?
                
                A cup of coffee, or a stroll in the park,
                Let's paint our canvas, where shadows embark.
                Fareeha, would you join me in this sweet chance,
                To waltz through time, in a tender romance?
                
                No grand gestures, just a humble plea,
                For a chapter together, just you and me.
                In the book of us, let's write a new page,
                Fareeha, may I take you on a gentle stage?
                
                So, if your heart whispers, even just a bit,
                Let's create a tale where two spirits commit.
                Fareeha, the question hangs in the air,
                Would you, in joy and laughter, with me share?
